                <h2>Services Offered</h2>
                <p>
                    Spokane Tree Pro offers professional tree services, including <a class="gien1" href="https://spokanetreeservicepros.com/tree-removal/"><u>tree removal</u></a>, pruning, and stump removal, with a focus on tree care maintenance.

                </p><p> 
                    One of the main benefits of professional tree care is pruning, which helps to maintain the health and appearance of trees. Proper pruning techniques help to remove dead or diseased branches, improve air circulation, and promote new growth. This can lead to a healthier, more attractive tree that is less susceptible to disease and insect infestations.
                </p><p> 
                    Spokane Tree Pro’s certified arborists use their expertise to determine the best pruning techniques for each tree, ensuring that the job is done correctly and safely.

                <h2>License and Insurance</h2>
                <p>
                    Having a business license, bond, and liability insurance are essential requirements for any legitimate tree service company. It is important for customers to verify that the tree service they are hiring has a business license, as unlicensed companies are illegal and may not have the necessary qualifications to safely perform tree services.
                </p><p> 
                    A bond is also important, as it serves as a form of insurance to protect the customer in case the company fails to complete the job or causes property damage. Liability insurance is crucial, as it covers any damage or injury that may occur during a job. Without liability insurance, the customer may be held responsible for any accidents or damages that occur during the tree service.
                </p><p> 
                    Tree service regulations require that companies be certified through organizations such as the International Society of Arboriculture, which ensures that the company has the necessary knowledge and skills to safely perform tree services. In addition, yearly insurance inspections are required to ensure that the company’s insurance is up to date and adequate.
                </p><p> 
                    Workers’ compensation for employees is also important, as it protects both the employee and the customer in case of injury on the job. A surety company is also necessary for compensation claims in case of severe property damage or major problems resulting from the job.
                </p><p> 
                    Overall, it is important for customers to choose a tree service that is licensed and insured to ensure a safe and successful job.</p>
